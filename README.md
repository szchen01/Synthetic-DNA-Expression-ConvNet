# Synthetic-Promoter-Data-CNN
I built these convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to train on synthetic DNA data as an exercise before building CNNs to train on real data. The models are based on this Towards Data Science article by Erin Wilson: https://towardsdatascience.com/modeling-dna-sequences-with-pytorch-de28b0a05036
